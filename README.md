FLAT TODO List 
==================

This is an offline webapp based on [Paul Lewis Weight Tracker webapp](https://github.com/paullewis/weight-tracker). 
I've dissected the application and I can say that I've learned several things about Javascript and CSS3. 
I have just the splashscreen of the app by now. If you want, you can take a look [here](http://rubensdev.com/todo-app).
